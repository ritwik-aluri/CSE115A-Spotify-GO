NOTES FOR US:
This covers details about unit tests, but we also need system tests
in general, presumably representing the scenarios we wrote up each of
the sprint reports

The equivalence classes making up the expected inputs of each module
are also listed, as well as the unit tests in this file that were
selected to cover them all and show that desired outputs are always
returned.
