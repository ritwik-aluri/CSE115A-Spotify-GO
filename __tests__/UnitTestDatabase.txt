OVERVIEW
This file contains details provided by each team member about the
module and functional testing they have done.
The equivalence classes making up the expected inputs of each module
are also listed, as well as the unit tests in this file that were
selected to cover them all and show that desired outputs are always
returned.

Database Interface Module

Details About Module______________________________
This module provides an interface to Google's Firebase: Realtime
Database. This is meant for use whenever any interfacing with the
database is required/desired, as it prevents the using programmer from
having to know about the Firebase API.
It provides:
    User initialization (with typechecks for fields' values) and
        deletion functions
    Setters for all fields (with typechecks) given user ID
    Getters for all fields given user ID
    Function to get nearby (within some latitude/longitude range of
        the current user) users

Details About Testing_____________________________
Each function type (initialization, deletion, setters, getters, and
the ever-important function to get nearby users) was tested manually
as it was implemented.
First, the user initialization was tested simply to check whether the
database was being updated with new user data. That's all it's
supposed to do anyway (and then typechecks were added and checked
towards the end of the release, because I could trust the Spotify
API class to return data correctly, but then I decided I would be
better safe than sorry). The typechecks weren't really tested, but a
simple test was done with an intentionally-bad field just to ensure
it works to some extent.
Then, the setters were created, placed at various points throughout
the code after a user was initialized, and the database was observed
manually to ensure that the updates were occurring. Typechecks were
also added near the end of the project and each tested with a single
incorrect value type each (just to see if they work).
The getters were created last (because we cared more about getting all
of the nearby users in full than each field) and tested to ensure that
the returned type is correct, but that's all.
The function to get nearby users was tested before the getters (but
after the user initialization and setters), also within the app and
via manual observation. I eliminated bugs that caused the app to stop
working, then bugs that prevented the access of returned data, and
then finally I checked the output in the "Nearby user/song list"
manually.
The user removal function was tested in the automated tests produced
at the end of the project (because that's when I learned how to create
automated unit tests).
The automated unit tests at the end of the project (within
"DBConfigInterface.test.js") were simply used more as a proof of
concept that unit testing with this module is possible and to keep
some tests that could be used in the future as changes to the module
are made. They do very basic typechecks (since there are so many
possible inputs, only one basic success and failure case is checked
per test).

Input Equivalence Classes and Relevant Tests______
See tests in "DBConfigInterface.test.js" for all related tests.
Any database user entry must be initialized such that their:
    Display name is a string
    Spotify account URL is a string
    Spotify account avatar URL is a string
    Premium status on Spotify is a boolean
    Consent as to whether or not they're sharing their location is a boolean
    Status of whether or not they're currently listening to a song is a boolean
    Latitude and Longitude are numbers
    Music's information (the song's Spotify ID, URL, name, the artist that made it, and the URL
        to the album art) is all given as strings
Any function calls using the DBInterface class that don't adhere to those criteria will result
in either:
    Failure to initialize the user
    Failure to update the user's data in the database (if the user was already initialized)
Therefore the equivalence classes of possible inputs to any DBInterface instance are represented by
the primitive type of each of the many individual variables passed into various functions in the
class. If the type of the passed parameters corresponding to each variable does not match the given
specifications, no change will occur in the database.
